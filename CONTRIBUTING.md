# Contributing to reprohack_site

This outlines how to propose a change to reprohack_site. 

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
demo.

### Pull request process

*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
  
*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the
current development version header describing the changes made followed by your
GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).
